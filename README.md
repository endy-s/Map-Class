# Map Class
Android Map class for M達o na Massa Project

## M達o na Massa Project
M達o na Massa is a social project that consists of programming classes for needed young people, aiming to show them how powerful programming is.

It started at the beginning of 2017, with only one Android class.
One new class is created every semester, so at the beginning of 2018 there are 3 classes:
* Beginner Android development class
* Basic Android development class
* Beginner Web development class

It is held by Cheesecake Labs, where I work as a Mobile developer, and all the teachers and monitors are volunteers.
I have been part of M達o na Massa for almost one year now, working as a monitor of Basic Android development classes in ending of 2017 and beginning of 2018.


## This Class
In this semester (beginning of 2018) I will be teaching how to show a Map in an Android app during two classes for the Basic Android development class. 

I created this repository to help me during the class (that is basically a live coding explaining every step with the students coding together) and to help future teachers that will be teaching Maps for future students.

### Thanks for checking it out!
Every feedback and contribution will be appreciated!
Let's spread the knowledge <3
